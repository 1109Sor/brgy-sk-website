        <p className="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Katlene is deeply committed to youth education and development. As the SK Kagawad spearheading the education committee, she leads various academic programs and literacy campaigns that aim to uplift students in Barangay Taloc.
        </p>
        <p className="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          One of her flagship initiatives is the <strong>EduKit Distribution Program</strong>, where she coordinates the provision of essential school supplies such as notebooks, pens, papers, and learning kits to underprivileged students every school year. This ensures that no child is left behind due to lack of materials.
        </p>
        <p className="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Katlene also organizes <strong>after-school tutorials</strong>, <strong>reading sessions</strong>, and <strong>scholarship information drives</strong> to help students boost their academic performance and gain access to further opportunities. Her leadership reflects a firm belief that education is a powerful tool to break the cycle of poverty and create long-term community impact.
